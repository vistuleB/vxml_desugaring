Missing features:

1. assigning several counters possibly separated by punctuation to a handle, for example

bob<<::::ChapterCounter.::++ExampleCounter

should assign the string "3.2" to handle "bob" if ChapterCounter is 3 and ExampleCounter is 2 at that point
(so writing "Exercise >>bob" will result in "Exercise 3.2", if this is how bob was defined)

2. creating an automatic HTML link (<a></a> tag) to the place a handle was defined, every time a handle is 
used; in the above example, anytime you type "Exercise >>bob" in the book, the "3.2" in "Exercise 3.2" would
link to the page/element where the handle is defined, for example, e.g. "chapters/chapter3#e2"

For 2. some important secondary changes need to happen. Specifically:

    - we need to remember where each handle is defined until after the link creation phase is over
    - we need to assign ids to elements that have handle; the id is != handle (because the handle is
    the author's private thought, you want to obfuscate that; a hangle might be "shithead_theorem"
    or sth for example)

For handles one must distinguish three different concepts:

    - ids (HTML element ids, the traditional notion); an id might be either user or auto-generated, and
    it needs to be unique to the HTML page in which its element lands, but not unique to the entire document (book)
    - handle names: are unique to entire document
    - handle values: each handle (name) has an associated value (string, e.g. "3.2"),

A diagram in which "handle" appears at the center of the three concepts:

    page name + element id on page  (e.g., "chapters/chapter3" for the page name and "e3" or "xf2" for the id)
            |
            |
            |
          handle
          /   \
         /     \
        /       \
       name     value

Or since the "name" is document-unique, you can think of the set of all handles as a Dict(String, #(String, String, String)):

Dict(String,    #(String,       String,       String))
//   handle       local path    element id    string value
//   name         of page       on page       of handle

A third missing feature we will tackle later (not this refactor):

3. automatic linking of certain nearby words, depending on what we tell the desugarer to do; for example instead of

    `Exercise <a href="/chapter3#e3">3.2</a>`

we would like:

    `<a href="/chapter3#e3">Exercise 3.2</a>`

We WILL NOT discuss how to implement feature 3. in this document. Only 1. & 2..

======

Feature 1.

We build a StatefulNodeToNodeTransform.

The state will consist of the current dictionary of counter names, types & values.

- For each non-text node:
    - For each text node child:
        - For each blamed_content.content (line of text):
            - break the line into List(Quirgy) and update the counter dictionary state,
            where:

                type Quirgy = {
                    ConnectorPuncutationText(String)                                             // the payload is one of '.', ',', ':', ';', '-', '::', '-'
                    OtherText(String)                                                            // the payload is not one of '.', ',', ':', ';', '-', '::', '-'
                    CounterIncrement(counter_name: String, updated_value: String, echo: Bool)  // (actually we will not use 'counter_name' but the code seems more legible if we put it)
                    HandleAssignment(handle_name: String)
                }

            For example the line
            
                "hello world global_bob<<..::ChapterCounter.local_bob<<::++ExerciseCounter"

            would give the list (I invent the counter values):

                [
                    OtherText("hello world "),
                    HandleAssignment("global_bob"),
                    CounterIncrement("ChapterCounter", "6", False),
                    ConnectorPuncutationText("."),
                    HandleAssignment("local_bob"),
                    CounterIncrement("ExerciseCounter", "7", True),
                ] : List(Quirgy)

            Note that breaking the line up like this may take several intermediate steps. 
            (I don't know.)

            - create a function called quirgies_prefix_handle_value:

            fn quirgies_prefix_handle_value(quirgies: List(Quirgy)) -> String {
                case quirgies {
                    [] -> ""
                    [OtherText(_), ..] -> "" // sic: we stop here, do not recurse
                    [HandleAssignment(_), ..rest] -> quirgies_prefix_handle_value(rest)
                    [ConnectorPuncutationText(p), ..rest] -> p <> quirgies_prefix_handle_value(rest)
                    [CounterIncrement(_, updated_value, _), ..rest] -> updated_value <> quirgies_prefix_handle_value(rest)
                }
            }

            - with

                type ComputedHandleAssignment = {
                    ComputedHandleAssignment(handle_name: String, handle_value: String)
                }

            create a function

                fn quirgies_processor(
                    quirgies: List(Quirgy),
                    string_so_far: String,
                    handle_assignments_so_far: List(ComputedHandleAssignment)
                ) -> Result(#(String, List(ComputedHandleAssignment)), Nil) {
                    case quirgies {
                        [] -> Ok(#(string_so_far, handle_assignments_so_far |> list.reverse))
                        [HandleAssignment(handle_name), ..rest] ->
                            case quirgies_prefix_handle_value(rest) -> {
                                "" -> Error(Nil)
                                nonempty_value -> quirgies_processor(
                                    rest,
                                    string_so_far,
                                    [ComputedHandleAssignment(handle_name, nonempty_value), ..handle_assignments_so_far]
                                )
                            }
                        [OtherText(t), ..rest] ->
                            quirgies_processor(
                                rest,
                                string_so_far <> t,
                                handle_assignments_so_far
                            )
                        [ConnectorPuncutationText(t), ..rest] ->
                            quirgies_processor(
                                rest,
                                string_so_far <> t,
                                handle_assignments_so_far
                            )
                        [CounterIncrement(_, updated_value, True), ..rest] ->
                            quirgies_processor(
                                rest,
                                string_so_far <> updated_value,
                                handle_assignments_so_far
                            )
                        [CounterIncrement(_, updated_value, False), ..rest] ->
                            quirgies_processor(
                                rest,
                                string_so_far,
                                handle_assignments_so_far
                            )
                    }
                }

            - use the Error of quirgies_processor to create a DesugaringError (with blame
            of content line) (of course)

            - in the non-Error return value

                #(String, List(ComputedHandleAssignment))

            of quirgies_processor, the String part will replace the line "content"; and for
            each ComputedHandleAssignment(name, value) you need to add an attribute:

                `handle <name> <value>`

            to the v-node that we're processing (that's why the loop starts with "for each)
            non-text node...": we need to be working with the parent of the text node that contained
            the line); there should not be an existing attribute `handle <name>` (with or without a
            following value) for this node, otherwise that's an error

            the handle-value dictionary is not recorded in this desugarer; there is still info
            missing for links and 

====

Feature 2.

Before replacing ">>handle" occurences:

2a. figure out the "local path" for each part of the document (e.g., "chapters/chapter1" or 
whatever), that should exist in some ancestor element of each tag (e.g., |> Chapter tag)

2b. write a desugarer that generates a unique 'id' attribute for each element that has a 
handle attribute; the generation can be any stupid way, also random (but unique);

2c. generate a global handle dictionary of the form...

    Dict(name: String, #(value: String, path: String, id: String))

...mentioned above. 

2d. replace each >>handle occurrence by the appropriate <a></a>


====



Feature 3.  ------FUTURE WORK NOT RIGHT NOW-------

Make fancier desugarers that can expand the <a>-tag of a handle to contain
more than just the handle, but some prefix words as well; and other tricks such as "more specific
links override nearby less specific links", e.g. we will find a way that instead of having

    Exercise >>ch3.>>quadratic_exercise

produce output such as

    Exercise <a href="chapters/chapter3">3</a>.<a href="chapters/chapter3/#zfxe2">2</a>

it will produce something like

    <a href="chapters/chapter3/#zfxe">Exercise 3.2</a>
